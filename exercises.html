      <h3>Exercise 1: Personal Class Website with Homepage</h3>
      <p>Your personal class website will be used to store and present all exercises and projects. It is your personal space so it should evolve over the course of the semester as your knowledge grows. It can be designed any way you'd like, 
        the only requirements are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A homepage which includes links to exercises, journal entries and projects</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We'll be using the GitHub developer platform to host the websites. The website will be stored in a "repository" which you can think of as a folder on your computer.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Create an account on <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> (make sure to verify the account) using your Fordham email.</li>
        <li>After you're logged in, go to your main repositories page. Click the NEW button.</li>
        <li>Name your repository whatever you would like (something like “class-site” if you can’t think of anything).</li>
        <li>Select PUBLIC (Anyone on the internet can see this repository).</li>
        <li>Check Add a README file.</li>
        <li>Leave other options as-is.</li>
        <li>Click CREATE REPOSITORY.</li>
        <li>You are now viewing the contents of the repository which is currently empty except for the README file. A README file is simply a description of the contents of the respository. Click the edit icon if you'd like to change the text of the README file.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>In order for your repository to be treated and rendered like a website, you need initialize GitHub Pages on this repository. Github pages is a feature offered by github that makes it easy and free to host handmade websites.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Click SETTINGS in the top navigation.</li>
        <li>Click PAGES in the left navigation.</li>
        <li>Under BRANCH, select MAIN. Click the SAVE button.</li>
        <li>Wait a few minutes and refresh the page. You will see your repo link: <i>your-github-username.github.io/class-site</i></li>
      </ol>
      <p>As you complete exercises and projects, you will add these files to the repo. In this exercise, we will create a homepage (index.html) but going forward, the process is:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Click the ADD FILE > UPLOAD FILES button at the top of the repository.</li>
        <li>Drag the new files or folders to the area indicated. </li>
        <li>COMMIT CHANGES - this is where you add some short description of what you've changed to keep track of your activity (something like "first upload", "updated homepage", "add new project", etc.)</li>
        <li>Wait a few minutes and then check your repo link.</li>
        <li>Add your URL to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14RwqACFeZJcsNBoy57XqGM6PWFMWoKKFxNMGisdC2yQ/edit?usp=drive_link" target="_blank">spreadsheet</a>.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Note: GitHub has many features, including a desktop app that automatically updates your repo. We will not be using the app but feel free to try out these features on your own computer.</p>

<h3>Exercise 2: Text and Images</h3>

<p><a href="https://pb-fordham.github.io/web-sp24/pdfs/dieter.md" target="_blank">Use this text</a> to recreate <i>Ten Principles for Good Design by Dieter Rams</i>. How can you communicate using text and images? Use what you know about HTML and CSS (also, refer to the <a href="https://pb-fordham.github.io/web-sp24/resources.html" target="_blank">resources</a>) and follow these instructions:</p>
<ul>
<li>One page only, a stylesheet and a folder for images</li>
  <li>Include one image for each of the 10 principles which demonstrates the principle in your opinion (be creative, do not use Dieter Ram images, you can also create your own images). These can be placed anywhere that makes sense within your design. Resize your images using the width or height attributes in HTML or use CSS; make sure they are not distorted.</li>
  <li>Use as many HTML tags and CSS properties as you'd like.</li>
   <li>In terms of design, think about what the choice of fonts, colors and placement of images says about what you're communicating.</li>
</ul>
 <p>Recommended Process:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create a local folder "exercise2". Folder should contain index.html, a stylesheet and a sub-folder for images.</li>
<li>When you are ready, upload this entire folder to your GitHub class website. The link should look something like: your-github-username.github.io/class-site/exercise2/. You can continue to edit and re-upload.</li>
<li>Add your URL to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14RwqACFeZJcsNBoy57XqGM6PWFMWoKKFxNMGisdC2yQ/edit?usp=drive_link" target="_blank">spreadsheet</a>.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Exercise 3 – Journal</h3>
<p>Based on the following readings from previous weeks, write a reflection using <i>your own words</i>. Consider these questions in your response: What is a website anyway? Why put things on the internet? Will websites someday become obsolete? What is your relationship with technology? Your journal entry can look like anything you want. It may or may not include media. Use as many words as you want to get your point across while demonstrating that you've read the articles.</p>
<p>Upload a folder to your GitHub class website. The URL should look something like: <i>your-github-username.github.io/class-site/exercise3/</i> Add the URL to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14RwqACFeZJcsNBoy57XqGM6PWFMWoKKFxNMGisdC2yQ/edit?usp=drive_link" target="_blank">spreadsheet</a>.</p>

<h3>Exercise 4 – Journal</h3>
<!--
      <p>Design an image collage using CSS grids.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Design a grid <a href="https://cssgrid-generator.netlify.app/" target="_blank">using this resource</a>. Figure out number of columns and rows, combine areas. Get the code for html and css.</li>
        <li>Modify the html and css. Add background images into each div area. Experiment with the height and width of the div areas. Also experiement with repeating background images, background image sizes (contain, cover).</li>

            <p>Write a reflection of this week's reading using <i>your own words</i>. What do you think the author is trying to say and how could it apply to the work you're doing in class? Your journal entry can look like anything you want. It may or may not include media. Use as many words as you want to get your point across while demonstrating that you've read the article.</p>
      <p>An additional requirement for this journal is to make it responsive by using <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_mediaqueries_ex.asp" target="_blank">media queries</a> to experiment with what happens when the screen is resized: do colors change? does type change size? do things appear or disappear? how might your journal change or adapt? how might your journal communicate different feelings or meanings when it adapts? </p>
      <p>Upload a folder to your GitHub class website. The URL should look something like: <i>your-github-username.github.io/class-site/exercise 4/</i>. Add the URL to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14RwqACFeZJcsNBoy57XqGM6PWFMWoKKFxNMGisdC2yQ/edit?usp=drive_link" target="_blank">spreadsheet</a>.</p>

      <h3>Exercise 5 – Refresh Homepage</h3>
<!--     

--> 

<div id="ex6" class="anchor"></div>
      <h3>Exercise 6 – Refresh Homepage</h3>
<!--
      <p>Return to your homepage from Exercise 1 and add links to all exercises and projects you've completed (the last project link should be added upon completion). Your homepage can look like anything you want - it serves as an archive of your class work.</p>
      <p>An additional requirement for this exercise is to add a reflection of this class and what you've learned. It is not a class evaluation, but rather some personal thoughts that could be based on the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How the web design skills we've covered may or may not help further your growth as a creative person.</li>
        <li>Are you satisfied with the work you produced?</li>
        <li>Has the class changed your views on art, technology or visual culture?</li>
        <li>Do you plan on using your skills in the future? Really, it's ok if you never plan on coding another website ever again but tell me more and be honest!</li>
        <li>Any closing remarks for the rest of the class?</li>
        <li>Your journal entry can look like anything you want. It's an opportunity to try out javascript if you want. It does not have to be responsive.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Replace the index.html and any other files in your main github repository. The URL should look something like: <i>your-github-username.github.io/class-site/</i>. Add the URL to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14RwqACFeZJcsNBoy57XqGM6PWFMWoKKFxNMGisdC2yQ/edit?usp=drive_link" target="_blank">spreadsheet</a>.</p>
