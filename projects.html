      <h3>Project 1: One-Page Website</h3>
      <p>Make a one-page website about your favorite book. Use this opportunity to use your beginner knowledge of HTML and CSS. You can include text, images, animated gifs, reviews, characters, your personal thoughts, original images you create, etc. Think about how the design of your webpage relates to the book. Be flexible with the presentation and design - you will likely not be able to do what you envision but work within those limitations. As in all projects, experiment! </p>
      <p>Requirements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>One page only (index.html), a stylesheet and a folder for images and other assets.</li>
        <li>Use as many HTML tags and CSS properties as you'd like.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Recommended Process:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Think about what kind of content you'd like to include and start gathering it. If using text from another website, please source and provide a link. </li>
        <li>Create a local folder "project1". Folder should contain index.html, a stylesheet and a sub-folder for images and other assets.</li>
        <li>When the project is complete, upload this entire folder to your GitHub class website. The link should look something like: <i>your-github-username.github.io/class-site/project1/</i>. You can continue to edit your project and re-upload.</li>
        <li>Add your URL to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14RwqACFeZJcsNBoy57XqGM6PWFMWoKKFxNMGisdC2yQ/edit?usp=drive_link" target="_blank">spreadsheet</a>.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Project 2: Website Critique</h3>
      <!--
      <p>Choose a website or app you use frequently or have used recently. Exclude social media such as IG, Facebook, TikTok, X/Twitter, WhatsApp, etc. and default apps on your devices such as Photos, Mail, Camera, Weather, etc. </p>
      <p>Critique the chosen website or app in terms of effectiveness and visual appeal. Your critique should be written in a Word or Google doc in paragraph form, 500–1000 words, and include screenshots or other graphics to illustrate your text. Use the guidelines below but you do not need to answer every question.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Introduction: What type of website is this (corporate, e-commerce, journalism, artist, blog, etc.) and what is its purpose? Examples: Does it aim to inform people about the company or organization, to advertise a product, to provide a means for online purchase, to recruit new clients/volunteers, to convince people of a particular cause? Who is the target audience?</li>
        <li>Content: Does the homepage direct you where to go or what to do? Does the site provide easy navigation to help you find content? Does the content contribute to the site’s purpose? Can you easily read the text? Do you easily get lost in the site?</li>
        <li>Visual Appeal: What is the visual hierarchy and how does the design accomplish it? Is there consistency with colors, fonts, layouts? Are there other engaging visual elements? Do the clickable elements stand out sufficiently? Are the typefaces appropriate? Does it work well on other devices?</li>
        <li>Recommendations: What could be improved and how?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Email me a Word doc, link to Google doc or PDF. While this project does not involve any code, it is still about <i>design</i>: how well you communicate and express ideas with words, how observant you are, how you can translate a website experience.</p>

      <h3>Project 3: Narrative</h3>
      <!--
      <p>Create a website that tells a story. You could use an existing short story, fairy tale, poem. Or, you can design a personal narrative: 24 hours in my day, a brief history of how my parents came to America, why the 1970's is the best decade for fashion, etc.</p>
      <p>Requirements:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Multiple pages or a single page with many layered elements.</li>
      <li>Words, phrases, paragraphs, images can link to other pages or elements that expands upon your narrative. Your website can be purely text, purely images or text and images combined.</li>
      <li>Think about the various ways users can access parts of the story - do they need to follow a set path (linear) or can they view the story in a random order (non-linear)? Can they go back and follow a different path, how will you lead them there? Also consider how your design will help the user figure out what to click on.</li>
      <li>Your website could be informative, artistic, or experimental. What’s important is that it demonstrates how the web can be used to communicate in a linear or non-linear way.</li>
      <li>Bonus if your website is responsive!</li>
    </ul>
      <p>Recommended Process</p>
      <ol>
      <li>Choose an existing story or write/compose the story. It could be written from beginning to end or you could write it as a series of ideas with no beginning or end. <b>Email me your project idea by Oct 26!</b></li>
      <li>Sketch out a site map to figure out how the pages are connected.</li>
      <li>Sketch out page layout ideas. Gather or create assets such as images or videos.</li>
      <li>Design with html/css in a local folder "project3". Folder should contain html pages, a stylesheet and a sub-folder for images and other assets.</li>
        <li>When the project is complete, upload this entire folder to your GitHub class website. The link should look something like: <i>your-github-username.github.io/class-site/project3/</i>. You can continue to edit your project and re-upload.</li>
        <li>Add your URL to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14RwqACFeZJcsNBoy57XqGM6PWFMWoKKFxNMGisdC2yQ/edit?usp=drive_link" target="_blank">spreadsheet</a>.</li>

      <h3>Project 4</h3>
 <!--  
<p>The final project is completely up to you! This gives you space to explore your personal goals and interests. Consider all the websites you’ve looked at and created. Which ones offer the kind of space you’re interested in making (think back to this <a href="pdfs/schwulst-mywebsiteisashiftinghouse.pdf" target="_blank">reading</a>)? What kind of space would you like to add to the web? What could you challenge yourself to make? Some ideas include:</p>
      <ul>
<li>Feel like telling another digital story? Choose different content, styles and methods from your last story.</li>
<li>Interested in creating something more corporate or practical (what does this even mean)? Hypothetically work with a company to digitally market a product or service. Or, make up your own company, product or service website.</li>
<li>Have a topic you want to communicate? Create a resource from your point of view (like our Moon website).</li>
<li>Want to be experimental? Use creative coding to visually explore animations, digital art, etc.</li>
      <li>Note: Personal portfolios are not an option.</li>
    </ul>
      <p>Requirements:</p>
      <ul>
<li>Make it personal and unique. In terms of content, that could mean your own images, illustrations, photos and writing. In terms of coding, can you go beyond what you might expect to see from a Squarespace or Wix template?</li>
      <li>Use html/css; js is optional.</li>
      <li>Bonus if your website is responsive!</li>
    </ul>
      <p>Process:</p>
      <ol>
<li>Due Nov. 30 - Email me an outline. What is the website and it's goals? Who is the intended audience/users? Remember an audience could be large or small. Describe some initial design ideas.</li>
      <li>Brainstorm, create a <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVNWsZmzg=/" target="_blank">sitemap</a>, gather assets, write, sketch.</li>
      <li>Design with html/css/js in a local folder "project4". Folder should contain html pages, a stylesheet, javascript and a sub-folder for images and other assets.</li>
        <li>When the project is complete, upload this entire folder to your GitHub class website. The link should look something like: <i>your-github-username.github.io/class-site/project4/</i>. You can continue to edit your project and re-upload.</li>
        <li>Add your URL to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14RwqACFeZJcsNBoy57XqGM6PWFMWoKKFxNMGisdC2yQ/edit?usp=drive_link" target="_blank">spreadsheet</a>.
      <li>On Thurs, Dec. 14 at 9:30am, be prepared to present your website. This is the final so no extensions!</li>
      <li><a href="https://calendar.app.google/uhTe2p9y66aybhM96" target="_blank">Make an appointment for extra office hours in Dec.</a></li>
