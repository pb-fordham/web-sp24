            <h4>About the Author</h4>
            <p>
                <br>Haruki Murakami was born in Kyoto, Japan, in 1949. He grew up in Kobe and then 
                moved to Tokyo, where he attended Waseda University.
                After college, Murakami opened a small jazz bar, which he and his wife ran for 
                seven years. <br><br>
                His first novel, Hear the Wind Sing, won the Gunzou Literature Prize for 
                budding writers in 1979. He followed this success with two sequels, Pinball, 
                1973 and A Wild Sheep Chase, which all together form “The Trilogy of the Rat.”
                Murakami is also the author of the novels Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of 
                the World; Norwegian Wood; Dance Dance Dance; South of the Border, West of the 
                Sun; The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle; Sputnik Sweetheart; Kafka on the Shore; After 
                Dark; 1Q84; Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage; and Killing 
                Commendatore. He has written five short story collections: The Elephant Vanishes; 
                After the Quake; Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman; Men Without Women; and First Person 
                Singular; and an illustrated novella, The Strange Library.<br><br>
                Additionally, Murakami has written several works of nonfiction. After the Hanshin 
                earthquake and the Tokyo subway sarin gas attack in 1995, he interviewed surviving 
                victims, as well as members of the religious cult responsible. From these interviews,
                 he published two nonfiction books in Japan, which were selectively combined to form 
                 Underground. He also wrote a series of personal essays on running, entitled What I Talk 
                 About When I Talk About Running, a conversation with friend and former Boston Symphony 
                 Orchestra conductor Seiji Ozawa entitled Absolutely on Music, a reflection on his personal 
                 t-shirt collection entitled Murakami T, and a unique look at the craft of writing entitled
                  Novelist as a Vocation.
                The most recent of his many international literary honors is the Jerusalem Prize, whose 
                previous recipients include J. M. Coetzee, Milan Kundera, and V. S. Naipaul. Murakami’s 
                work has been translated into more than fifty languages.<br><br></p>

            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <br>Comprising two distinct but interrelated plots, the narrative runs back and forth between both plots, taking up each plotline in alternating chapters.<br><br>
            The odd-numbered chapters tell the 15-year-old Kafka's story as he runs away from his father's house to escape an Oedipal curse and to embark upon a quest to find his mother and sister. After a series of adventures, he finds shelter in a quiet, private library in Takamatsu, run by the distant and aloof Miss Saeki and the intelligent and more welcoming Oshima. There he spends his days reading the unabridged Richard Francis Burton translation of One Thousand and One Nights and the collected works of Natsume Sōseki until the police begin inquiring after him in connection with the murder of his father that he does not know he has committed. Oshima brings him to the forests of Kōchi Prefecture, where Kafka is ultimately healed.<br><br>
            The even-numbered chapters tell Nakata's story. They start with military reports of a strange incident in Yamanashi Prefecture where multiple children, including Nakata, collapse in the woods – Nakata, after the incident, is the only one of the children who came out of the incident without any memory and unable to read and write. The incident is initially blamed on poisonous gas, but it is later revealed that it was the result of a lustful teacher beating Nakata. Later on in the book, it is shown that due to his uncanny abilities, Nakata has found part-time work in his old age as a finder of lost cats (Murakami's earlier work The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle also involves searching for a lost cat). Having finally located and returned one particular cat to its owners, Nakata finds that the circumstances of the case have put him on a path which, unfolding one step at a time before him, takes the illiterate man far away from his familiar and comforting home territory. Nakata kills a man named Johnnie Walker, a cat murderer. He takes a gigantic leap of faith in going on the road for the first time in his life, unable even to read a map and without knowing where he will eventually end up. He befriends a truck driver named Hoshino, who takes him on as a passenger in his truck and soon becomes very attached to the old man. He heads for Takamatsu, an unknown force driving him there.<br>
