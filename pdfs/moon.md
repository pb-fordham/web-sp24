If the moon smiled, she would resemble you. You leave the same impression Of something beautiful, but annihilating.
~Sylvia Plath

The Moon and I
by Annette Wynne

We played a gameâ€”the moon and I,
The moon was laughing in the sky,
I spied her, too, and called aloud,
But still she hid behind a cloud.
