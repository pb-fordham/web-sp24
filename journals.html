      <h3>Journal Entry 1</h3>
      <p>Based on the following readings, write a reflection using <i>your own words</i>. What is a website anyway? Why put things on the internet? Will websites someday become obsolete? Your journal entry can look like anything you want. It may or may not include media. Use as many words as you want to get your point across.</p>
      <p>Upload a folder to your GitHub class website. The URL should look something like: <i>your-github-username.github.io/class-site/journal1/</i> Add the URL to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14RwqACFeZJcsNBoy57XqGM6PWFMWoKKFxNMGisdC2yQ/edit?usp=drive_link" target="_blank">spreadsheet</a>.</p>

      <h3>Journal Entry 2 - Due Nov 16</h3>
      <p>Revisit the reading below and write a reflection using <i>your own words</i>. What do you think the author is trying to say and how could it apply to the work you're doing in this class? Your journal entry can look like anything you want. It may or may not include media. Use as many words as you want to get your point across.</p>
      <p>An additional requirement for this journal is to make it responsive by using <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_mediaqueries_ex.asp" target="_blank">media queries</a> to experiment with what happens when the screen is resized: do colors change? does type change size? do things appear or disappear? how might your journal change or adapt? how might your journal communicate different feelings or meanings when it adapts? Revisit <i>Moon</i> or <i>Where are you</i> to see media queries in action.</p>
      <p>Upload a folder to your GitHub class website. The URL should look something like: <i>your-github-username.github.io/class-site/journal2/</i>. Add the URL to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14RwqACFeZJcsNBoy57XqGM6PWFMWoKKFxNMGisdC2yQ/edit?usp=drive_link" target="_blank">spreadsheet</a>.</p>

      <h3>Journal Entry 3 - Due Dec 7</h3>
      <p>This last journal entry is a reflection of this class and what you've learned. It is not a class evaluation, but rather some personal thoughts that could be based on the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How the web design skills we've covered may or may not help further your growth as a creative person.</li>
        <li>Are you satisfied with the work you produced?</li>
        <li>Has the class changed your views on art, technology or visual culture?</li>
        <li>Do you plan on using your skills in the future? Really, it's ok if you never plan on coding another website ever again but tell me more and be honest!</li>
        <li>Any closing remarks for the rest of the class?</li>
        <li>Your journal entry can look like anything you want. It's an opportunity to try out javascript if you want. It does not have to be responsive.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Upload a folder to your GitHub class website. The URL should look something like: <i>your-github-username.github.io/class-site/journal3/</i>. Add the URL to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14RwqACFeZJcsNBoy57XqGM6PWFMWoKKFxNMGisdC2yQ/edit?usp=drive_link" target="_blank">spreadsheet</a>.</p>
