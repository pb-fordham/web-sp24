      <h3>Course Overview </h3>
      <p>In this course, we will look at the fundamentals of website design from a practical, visual and technical perspective. We’ll focus on the basic languages of front-end web development: HTML, CSS, and basic Javascript in conjunction with the principles of graphic design and best practices of user experience. For our purposes, web development is an artistic tool. As such, this course emphasizes handcrafted, creative code and design. Our websites will not be automated or built from templates. Instead they will be personalized, conceptual, experimental and communicative. They may also be messy and imperfect but that’s ok! Through project-based assignments and readings, we will examine the space of the web at large and explore and challenge what a website is. 
        No prior programming experience is required.</p>

<p>Note on Appropriation: Writing code almost always involves the appropriation and adaptation of other people’s code. In this class we are participating in communities of shared practices. However, any work you borrow and/or modify must be labeled as such. If you find sample code and integrate it into your work, this must be clearly and obviously indicated as such by using inline comments in your code - this includes generative AI tools (such as ChatGPT). Failure to do so will be considered the same as any other breach of academic integrity. Do not plagiarize code as a quick solution - your code can incorporate the ideas of others but should reflect your original, creative approach to the problem.</p>
